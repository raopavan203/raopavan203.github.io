## Summary

We are going to create optimized implementations of the deduplication module in CloudFS (a hybrid cloud-backed local file system, developed in 18-746: Storage Systems), that makes use of Rabin fingerprinting for chunking, on both GPU and multi-core CPU platforms, and perform a detailed analysis of both systems' performance characteristics.

### Background

  In file systems, a common way to avoid redundant computations and storage is to perform deduplication on the data. Hence, it is important to detect duplicate content during any write/update operation in the filesystem. The most effective way to detect duplicate content is to use content-based chunking. The Rabin fingerprinting algorithm is a popular content-based chunking algorithm. This involves defining chunk boundaries in a file, based on the content and not a fixed offset. This leads to variable sized chunks. A scan of the entire new/changed content is made and fingerprints are calculated over a sliding window of data. This calculation involves polynomial division of a polynomial of degree w-1 for a w bit sequence, with an irreducible polynomial of degree k. This is a very computationally intensive operation. The high computational cost is evident especially in writes of large sizes, when these large writes need to be re-chunked each time they are updated. The computation time is this case is greater than the I/O or bandwidth latency of the filesystem and it is thus, compute-bound. 
  
  Hence, content based chunking algorithm will definitely benefit from parallelism as it will directly improve the file system throughput. We plan to analyse the improvement in performance by parallelizing the chunking algorithm across multiple cores of a CPU as well as parallelizing using a GPU. Parallelization can be achieved such that each openMP or CUDA thread will work on a separate section of input and computes the Rabin fingerprint of that region in a sliding window manner. 

### Challenges

- ***Parallelization of Rabin fingerprinting***
Rabin fingerprinting is a content-based rolling hash technique, which uses sliding window mechanism to detect chunk boundaries. Currently, this is a single-threaded library implementation. It will be challenging to come up with an efficient parallel scheme for both multi-core and GPU versions for this task without causing other overheads.

- ***Hiding CPU-GPU data transfer overheads***
When deduplication computations are offloaded to GPU, the file system will need to transfer data to be chunked to the GPU memory and results back to CPU memory, per request. The cudaMemcpy overhead can potentially undo the speedup obtained by using GPU acceleration. This data-transfer latency can be hidden by overlapping the transfer of input data to GPU with computation step of a previous task. Efficiently designing the CPU-GPU interface to overlap these operations will be a challenging task. 

- ***Hiding GPU memory allocation overheads***
Moreover, we need to use non-pageable host memory for DMA between host and device. Since allocating non-pageable host memory is an expensive operation, it makes sense to reuse the buffers used to transport the GPU input data. This poses a challenging task of efficiently managing the non-pageable memory buffers by ensuring that the expensive cudaMalloc and cudaFree calls are amortized across the lifetime of the file system process.

- ***Efficient use of GPU shared memory***
Since the GPU shared memory is much smaller than the amount of data to be processed during Rabin fingerprinting, efficiently using this limited amount of shared memory will be a challenge. Moreover, shared memory is divided into banks and all reads and writes that access the same bank are serialized by the GPU memory subsystem, which would limit potential parallelism. Thus, enforcing the concurrent CUDA threads to access data on different banks will be a challenging task. In addition, trading off the use of high number of threads to hide latency, for amount of shared memory available per thread is another challenge we foresee.
